This R Markdown template can be used for the ZZSC9020 course report. You
can incorporate R (R Core Team, 2017) chunks and Python chunks that will
be run on the fly. You can incorporate \LaTeX~commands.

\bigskip

Before submitting the last version of your report, you might want to use
\url{https://overleaf.com} to collaborate with other members of your
team directly on the \LaTeX~version of this document (which is a
byproduct you get when you Knit it from studio).

\bigskip

We suggest you organise your report using the following chapters but,
depending on your own project, nothing prevents you to have a different
organisation.

\hypertarget{literature-review}{%
\chapter{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}}

Here are a few references that can be useful: (Xie et al., 2018) and
(Lafaye de Micheaux et al., 2013). See also

\bigskip

In order to incorporate your own references in this report, we strongly
advise you use BibTeX. Your references then needs to be recorded in the
file \texttt{references.bib}.

R and Python of course are great software for Data Science. Sometimes,
you might want to use \texttt{bash} utilities such as \texttt{awk} or
\texttt{sed}.

Of course, to ensure reproducibility, you should use something like
\texttt{Git} and RMarkdown (or a Jupyter Notebook). Do \textbf{not} use
Word!

\hypertarget{description-of-the-data}{%

files? etc.

\section{A First Model}\label{a-first-model}}

Having a very simple model is always good so that you can benchmark any
result you would obtain with a more elaborate model.

\bigskip

For example, one can use the linear regression model

\[
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \cdots \beta_p x_{pi} + \epsilon_i, \qquad i=1,\ldots,n.
\] where it is assumed that the \(\epsilon_i\)'s are i.i.d.~\(N(0,1)\).

Issues}\label{conclusion-and-further-issues}}

``client''? What further analysis could be done in the future?
