# ZZSC9020 Data Science Project group G - Watt's Up Down Unda


This GitHub repository is the main point of access for students and lecturers of the ZZSC9020 capstone course. 

In this repository, you will find the data to start developing your project. Also, we will use the repository to share code, documentation, data, models and other resources between the group members and course lecturers.

### Brief project description

How does the integration of renewable energy features affect electricity demand forecasting accuracy.
Specifically does including the features, 'solar generation capacity' (domestic and residential), and 'solar radiation' improve the forecasting accuracy of electricity demand compared with just using temperature alone. In effect, we will attempt to conduct the below hypothesis test for a number of different modelling approaches.
 
1.	Null Hypothesis: Temperature data alone is sufficient to reliably forecast electricity demand
2.	Alternative Hypothesis: Including the additional features of  'solar generation capacity' and/or 'solar radiation' improves the estimate of electricity demand
