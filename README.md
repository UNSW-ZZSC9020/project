### Brief project description

Transforming the electricity network into a 100% renewable energy scenario is a crucial, but challenging priority in New South Wales (NSW). Achieving this target as soon as possible will result in a greater reduction of potential climate impacts within the region. However, a key concern is whether renewable sources can reliably provide enough electricity to meet NSW demand. The aim of this project is to provide a key environmental advocacy firm in NSW, The Ecological Defenders Office, with evidence-based forecasts to answer the following question: 
Is the transition to a fully renewable energy-based electricity supply achievable within NSW in the next 10 years? 
The output from this analysis and modelling will empower the Ecological Defenders Office (EDO) to make informed advocacy and funding decisions.
