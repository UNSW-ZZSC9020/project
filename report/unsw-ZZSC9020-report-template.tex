\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This R Markdown template can be used for the ZZSC9020 course report. You
can incorporate R \cite{R} chunks and Python chunks that will be run on
the fly. You can incorporate \LaTeX commands.

\bigskip

Before submitting the last version of your report, you might want to use
\url{https://overleaf.com} to collaborate with other members of your
team directly on the \LaTeX version of this document (which is a
byproduct you get when you Knit it from studio).

\bigskip

We suggest you organise your report using the following chapters but,
depending on your own project, nothing prevents you to have a different
organisation.

\chapter{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

Here are a few references that can be useful: \cite{Xie2018} and
\cite{Lafaye2013}. See also
\url{https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/}

\bigskip

In order to incorporate your own references in this report, we strongly
advise you use BibTeX. Your references then needs to be recorded in the
file \texttt{references.bib}.

\chapter{Material and Methods}\label{material-and-methods}

\section{Software}\label{software}

R and Python of course are great software for Data Science. Sometimes,
you might want to use \texttt{bash} utilities such as \texttt{awk} or
\texttt{sed}.

Of course, to ensure reproducibility, you should use something like
\texttt{Git} and RMarkdown (or a Jupyter Notebook). Do \textbf{not} use
Word!

\section{Description of the Data}\label{description-of-the-data}

How are the data stored? What are the sizes of the data files? How many
files? etc.

\section{Pre-processing Steps}\label{pre-processing-steps}

What did you have to do to transform the data so that they become
useable?

\section{Data Cleaning}\label{data-cleaning}

How did you deal with missing data? etc.

\section{Assumptions}\label{assumptions}

What assumptions are you making on the data?

\section{Modelling Methods}\label{modelling-methods}

\chapter{Exploratory Data Analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}

This is where you explore your data using histograms, scatterplots,
boxplots, numerical summaries, etc.

\end{verbatim}

\chapter{Analysis and Results}\label{analysis-and-results}

\section{A First Model}\label{a-first-model}

Having a very simple model is always good so that you can benchmark any
result you would obtain with a more elaborate model.

\bigskip

For example, one can use the linear regression model

\[
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \cdots \beta_p x_{pi} + \epsilon_i, \qquad i=1,\ldots,n.
\] where it is assumed that the \(\epsilon_i\)'s are i.i.d.~\(N(0,1)\).

\chapter{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Put the results you got in the previous chapter in perspective with
respect to the problem studied.

\chapter{Conclusion and Further
Issues}\label{conclusion-and-further-issues}

What are the main conclusions? What are your recommendations for the
``client''? What further analysis could be done in the future?
