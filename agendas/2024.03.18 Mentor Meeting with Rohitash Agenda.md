## Agenda Items

Who | Question
---- | ----
Tom | Will the model still be considered multivariate if all features are engineered from one variable?
Doug | Is the three-pages limit for the project plan a hard limit?
Tom | What proportion of the final submission should be the literature review? Out of, say, 30 pages, how many pages should the review be?
Doug | The week two material on Moodle suggests that, after we submit assessment 1, we should be focusing on the literature review and developing a strategy for imputing missing data. Is there anything else we need to be doing at this point?
Doug | Can we store things like code and plots in the GitHub repo, or is our use of it restricted to the provided folders?
Tom | Is focusing on three models a good idea?
