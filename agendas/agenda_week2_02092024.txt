Q: What are next steps? 

Questions about report: 

- Software/ model description in literature review or software description? 

- Team members role 

- Gantt chart or Mind map in the report 

- What if a model chosen does not provide decent results? Can we still describe the approach and potential reasons ? Would we loose marks if the results are not ideal?  

- Would you recommend trying out LSTM model considering time it takes to build 

- Any suggestion for selecting a base model 

- Can we use pretrained model?
