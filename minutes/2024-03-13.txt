- demand is consistant thru aus, NSW is higher
- total demand in MW
- used shape
- used head, tail, shape
- 30 minute intervaL for demand, it's variable for the forecasts
- task: make the dates consistent
- the question about solar panel is a very good
    - "how the increase 
- it's a seasonal pattern,

- use stanndard template
- gantt chart
- motivation
- start from high level goal: why energy is important, why is forcasting is important
    both over/under estimation are bad

- give a litterature review
- methods: what methods will we be using? statistical/ machine learning (ex: XGBoost/LSTM for energy load forcasting)/ econometric models for energy load forcasting 
    use high lelvel: google "satistical methods for energy demand", regression problem.
- we can google "fithub energy load forcasting with LSTM"
- Use RNN

- I will read papers on LSTM for energy load forcasting 
- intro / motivation
